/* A simple Project for Remote Controlling with nRF24L01+ radios. 
 We have 2 nodes, the transmitter (this one) and the receiver which is attached to the Car.
 The idea is to transmit  2 parameters , one is Direction (Backward, or Forward with the speed) the other is the Steering (Left, or Right with the degree of rotation).
 The nRF24L01 transmit values in type of "uint8_t" with maximum of 256 for each packet, so the values of direction is divided by (10) at the Tx side,
 then it is multiplied by 10 again at the Rx side.
 The Rx rules is to output the received parameters to port 3 and 6 where the Servo and the ESC are are attached
 a condition is required to prevent the controller from transmitting values that is not useful (like 1480-1530 for ESC and 88-92 for Servo) to save more power as much as we can
